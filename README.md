# Overview
This project's goal is to compare the A* Algorithm with other pathfinding algorithms like Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) for robot pathfinding in a weighted grid environment. 

The grid consists of different terrain types that have varying movement costs, such as water, grass, mud, and traffic. 

The algorithms are used to find the optimal path from a start position to a goal position while considering these terrain costs.
